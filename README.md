# Employee-Management-System-using-keycloak-has-the-User-Manager
This project is an employee manager which is built on Java and springboot framework
It uses Keycloak to authorize and authenticate users and also uses the keycloak server to store user details, generate token and so on
The project is in progress and I hope to implement MFA and LDAP in the future.
